   (yes): Excellent!
   (no) : You better get all your things, you dont want to be late!

There are 5 of you going to vancouver for a special event and you have to make it there on time.

you have the choice to take one car or two cars. Whats your Choice?
Note: The driver will have to pick up everyone and you guys cant be late to the event

(one car): Good Luck, drive safe
(two cars): Let's see if this is a smart choice.

The Car you are in is just you and one other friend. Your friend is trying to get to Vancouver on time, if not early so you both 
wouldnt miss out on anything.

Do you prefer for him to drive safe and take your guys time or drive faster without making any stops?
(drive safe.......): Great! you h
(drive faster....?): Not a smart choice. Game over. PLEASE REFRESH PAGE!"):
throw new Error();
}

You and your friend are 30min away from the Peace Arch border. Good Job!

You have made it more than halfway to your destination but, you do not know where the other half of your group is. Are you going
to keep  on driving or stop somewhere and wait for them?
(keep on driving): Snake move, but smart!
(wait...): you are risking your chance on getting to vanciuver on time, keep on going and see where you end up.


Suddenly your friend starts to get really hungry and wants to get food since you are ahead of your friends already. Are you
going to get food or continue drivig.
(food): How generous, but dont take too long
(continue): wow! you are such a great friend.

RING RING RING!!!! you recieve a call from your friend. Your friend tells you that they have reached the border and you all have 
an hour left to get to the event.

you and your friend have not yet finished eating. Do you continue to eat or hurry and get back on the Road?
(eat): you have lost your mind! hurry up!!
(drive): Excellent choic! now drive safe.

At this ppoint your other friends have successfully passed the border and are waiting for you at the other side. It is now your
turn to pass the border and you find out you have forgot your passport at home and have no other document on you. 

They send you to their office and try to figure things out but nothing seems to work. Your only other choice is to drop your friend 
at the border and go back home.

With your disorganized self you are now debating what to do. Are you going to get your documents and drive back again towards
vancouver and enjoy the time you will have with your friends or are you going to just go home and stay at home?
(drive back): Great! you may be disorganized but you sure are commited\
(stay home): Good. Next time double check that you are for sure ready to leave for vacation.
